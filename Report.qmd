# Executive Summary
This proposal evaluates the effectiveness of a 4-dimensional bubble chart used to present "Technical Layoffs Since the Fed Began Raising Interest Rates" and recommends a redesigned approach that simplifies the visual elements to reveal underlying trends with greater clarity.

# Introduction & Original Visualization

:::

## Context
The visualisation maps layoff from January 2022 to May 2023 across industry sectors and layoff volume. The x-axis represents chronological progression while the y-axis categorises industry sectors, bubble size indicates the number of employees laid off, and colour differentiates sector groupings. This visualisation was selected because it shows the direct correlation between macroeconomic policy and the stability of the workforce. It demonstrates how the increase in interest rates triggered a contraction in the job market. The visualization attempts to illustrate the impact of tighter financial conditions on employment patterns by displaying an increasing size of layoffs subsequent to the increased interest rates.

## Critique of the Original Design

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Data Representation:** The visualisation provides a comprehensive, chronological view of layoffs across multiple sectors, allowing for a broad understanding of the impact of interest rate hikes.\
- **Use of Size:** Different bubble sizes effectively indicate the scale of layoffs, giving a quick visual cue about the magnitude of job losses in each sector.\

### Weaknesses
Packing four variables into a single chart violates several core data visualization principles:\
- **Severe Overplotting and Occlusion:** Massive bubbles representing companies physically cover up dozens of smaller layoff events in the same time period.\
- **The "Area" Perception Problem:** Human visual perception is poor at comparing 2D areas, making it difficult to differentiate the scale of layoffs between overlapping bubbles.\
- **High Cognitive Load:** The viewer's brain must simultaneously track the timeline, find the specific industry on the Y-axis, estimate the bubble area, and match color to a legend.\
- **Misleading Density:** The volume of overlapping circles in sections like "Big Tech" and "Retail" obscures the individual data points and specific dates.

# Methodology & Improvement Strategy

## Planned Improvements
To resolve the occlusion and cognitive load issues, our primary strategy is to break the overloaded 4D chart into smaller components using a **Small Multiples** design strategy. This involves creating a grid of individual, aligned scatter plots categorised by major sector groupings. 

## Data Source
- **Primary Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022 \
Data will be extracted from the Kaggle dataset, which contains detailed records of layoffs across various industries, including dates, company names, and layoff counts. Unlike the original visualisation which focused only on U.S. based companies, this dataset provides a global perspective, documenting layoff events internationally.


## Data Preparation
The initial step involves extracting the original variables (Date, Industry Sector, Layoff Count, and Company) and filtering the dataset for missing values to ensure data quality.
```{r}
#| label: data-prep
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# 1. Load the raw dataset
layoffs_raw <- read_csv("layoffs_data.csv")

# 2. Clean and transform the data
layoffs_clean <- layoffs_raw %>%
  
  # Convert the 'Date' column from text to actual Date objects
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) %>%
  
  # Extract Year and Month into separate columns (useful for aggregating bar charts later)
  mutate(Year = year(Date),
         Month = month(Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>%
  
  # Drop administrative/text columns that are not useful for visualization
  select(-Source, -Date_Added, -List_of_Employees_Laid_Off) %>%
  
  # Convert categorical variables into 'factors' for easier plotting in ggplot2
  mutate(Industry = as.factor(Industry),
         Country = as.factor(Country),
         Stage = as.factor(Stage)) %>%
  
  # Handle Missing Values: Keep rows where AT LEAST ONE of the metrics is known
  # (Some companies report percentage laid off, but not the raw count, or vice versa)
  filter(!is.na(Laid_Off_Count) | !is.na(Percentage))

# 3. View a summary of the cleaned data
glimpse(layoffs_clean)
```

## Visualization Strategy & Final Design Choices
- **Chart Type:** Transitioned from a single, crowded bubble chart to small multiple scatter plots for each sector.\
- **Visual Encodings:** The X and Y axes remain consistent across all plots. Bubble size is retained for layoff volume, but with clutter removed, scaling is easier to interpret.\
- **Clarity:** Gridlines are softened and the color palette is standardized  to ensure final result is aesthetically pleasing and professional.

# Data Analysis Plan
To complement our redesigned visualization, we plan to conduct a set of exploratory data analyses that strengthen the narrative around how interest rate hike influenced layoffs across the tech sector.

The purpose of this analysis is to move beyond descriptive visualization and provide quantitative evidence that supports the patterns observed in both the original and improved visualizations. The planned analyses include:

## Analytical Objectives

The analysis will be guided by the following objectives which align with the overall project goal of evaluating how macroeconomic policy may have influenced workforce stability within the technology sector:

- **To examine temporal trends in layoff activity** and determine whether there is a significant escalation in layoff volume following the interest rate increases in 2022.\
- **To identify which industries were disproportionately affected**, in terms of both frequency of layoff events and total employees laid off.\
- **To compare layoff magnitude across company stages**, such as Post-IPO firms versus earlier-stage startups.\
- **To explore the relationship between funding levels and layoff behaviour**, particularly whether companies that raised more capital exhibited different layoff patterns.

### Time-Series Aggregation

The first analysis we plan to conduct is the aggregation of layoff data on a monthly basis to compute:

- Total number of employees laid off per month\
- Number of layoff announcements per month

This will allow us to compare layoff patterns before and after the onset of interest rate hikes. The results will provide empirical support for the narrative presented in the visualization.

### Industry-Level Comparative Analysis
Next, industry categories will be analysed to determine:

- Total layoffs by industry\
- Average layoffs per event\
- Relative frequency of layoff announcements

This analysis will reveal whether certain sectors experienced structural vulnerability or whether layoffs were evenly distributed across industries.

### Company Stage Analysis
Using the `Stage` variable, we would like to compare layoff behaviour across company maturity levels. Specifically, we will examine:

- Mean layoff count per stage\
- Distribution of layoff percentages

This comparison may highlight whether publicly listed firms or venture-backed startups responded differently to tightening financial conditions.

### Exploratory Correlation Analysis
We will conduct an exploration of the relationship between:

- Funds raised\
- Layoff count\
- Percentage of workforce laid off

Scatterplots and simple correlation measures will be used to investigate potential associations. Our aim is to uncover patterns that may inform the improved visualization design.

## Expected Outcome
We believe that the planned analysis will help our team to :

- Provide quantitative validation for trends observed visually.\
- Strengthen the interpretability and credibility of the redesigned visualization.\
- Improve storytelling beyond the limitations of the original bubble chart.
