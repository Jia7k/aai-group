# Executive Summary
This proposal evaluates the effectiveness of a 4-dimensional bubble chart used to present "Technical Layoffs Since the Fed Began Raising Interest Rates" and recommends a redesigned approach that simplifies the visual elements to reveal underlying trends with greater clarity.

# Introduction & Original Visualization

:::

## Context
The visualisation maps layoff from January 2022 to May 2023 across industry sectors and layoff volume. The x-axis represents chronological progression while the y-axis categorises industry sectors, bubble size indicates the number of employees laid off, and colour differentiates sector groupings. This visualisation was selected because it shows the direct correlation between macroeconomic policy and the stability of the workforce. It demonstrates how the increase in interest rates triggered a contraction in the job market. The visualization attempts to illustrate the impact of tighter financial conditions on employment patterns by displaying an increasing size of layoffs subsequent to the increased interest rates.

## Critique of the Original Design

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Data Representation:** The visualisation provides a comprehensive, chronological view of layoffs across multiple sectors, allowing for a broad understanding of the impact of interest rate hikes.\
- **Use of Size:** Different bubble sizes effectively indicate the scale of layoffs, giving a quick visual cue about the magnitude of job losses in each sector.\

### Weaknesses
Packing four variables into a single chart violates several core data visualization principles:\
- **Severe Overplotting and Occlusion:** Massive bubbles representing companies physically cover up dozens of smaller layoff events in the same time period.\
- **The "Area" Perception Problem:** Human visual perception is poor at comparing 2D areas, making it difficult to differentiate the scale of layoffs between overlapping bubbles.\
- **High Cognitive Load:** The viewer's brain must simultaneously track the timeline, find the specific industry on the Y-axis, estimate the bubble area, and match color to a legend.\
- **Misleading Density:** The volume of overlapping circles in sections like "Big Tech" and "Retail" obscures the individual data points and specific dates.

# Methodology & Improvement Strategy

## Planned Improvements
To resolve the occlusion and cognitive load issues, our primary strategy is to break the overloaded 4D chart into smaller components using a **Small Multiples** design strategy. This involves creating a grid of individual, aligned scatter plots categorised by major sector groupings. 

## Data Source
- **Primary Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022 \
Data will be extracted from the Kaggle dataset, which contains detailed records of layoffs across various industries, including dates, company names, and layoff counts. Unlike the original visualisation which focused only on U.S. based companies, this dataset provides a global perspective, documenting layoff events internationally.


## Data Preparation
The initial step involves extracting the original variables (Date, Industry Sector, Layoff Count, and Company) and filtering the dataset for missing values to ensure data quality.
```{r}
#| label: data-prep
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# 1. Load the raw dataset
layoffs_raw <- read_csv("layoffs_data.csv")

# 2. Clean and transform the data
layoffs_clean <- layoffs_raw %>%
  
  # Convert the 'Date' column from text to actual Date objects
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) %>%
  
  # Extract Year and Month into separate columns (useful for aggregating bar charts later)
  mutate(Year = year(Date),
         Month = month(Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>%
  
  # Drop administrative/text columns that are not useful for visualization
  select(-Source, -Date_Added, -List_of_Employees_Laid_Off) %>%
  
  # Convert categorical variables into 'factors' for easier plotting in ggplot2
  mutate(Industry = as.factor(Industry),
         Country = as.factor(Country),
         Stage = as.factor(Stage)) %>%
  
  # Handle Missing Values: Keep rows where AT LEAST ONE of the metrics is known
  # (Some companies report percentage laid off, but not the raw count, or vice versa)
  filter(!is.na(Laid_Off_Count) | !is.na(Percentage))

# 3. View a summary of the cleaned data
glimpse(layoffs_clean)
```

## Visualization Strategy & Final Design Choices
- **Chart Type:** Transitioned from a single, crowded bubble chart to small multiple scatter plots for each sector.\
- **Visual Encodings:** The X and Y axes remain consistent across all plots. Bubble size is retained for layoff volume, but with clutter removed, scaling is easier to interpret.\
- **Clarity:** Gridlines are softened and the color palette is standardized  to ensure final result is aesthetically pleasing and professional.

# Data Analysis Plan
To complement our redesigned visualization, we plan to conduct a set of basic exploratory data analyses that strengthen the narrative around how interest rate hike influenced layoffs across the tech sector.

The analyses will focus on uncovering relationships, identifying temporal patterns and validating whether the layoffs observed in the original visualization reflect broader structural changes in the industry. The planned analyses include:

## Trend Analysis of Layoffs Over Time
We will compute monthly aggregated layoff counts to examine how the volume of job cuts evolved from 2022 to 2023. This analysis will support our redesigned chart by providing evidence-based context for the observed patterns. This will also help to answer some of the following questions:

- When did layoffs begin accelerating?\
- Did layoff intensity spike immediately after the interest rate increases?\
- Were there sustained or repeated waves of downsizing?

## Sector-Level Comparison
In order to illustrate which sectors were disproportionately affected and whether some sectors were more sensitive to rising interest rates, we will calculate the following for each industry category:

- total layoffs\
- percentage proportion of total layoffs\
- relative severity measured as layoffs per company

## Company-Level Outlier Detection
We will identify companies with layoff counts that significantly exceed sector norms with the following techniques:

- z‑scores\
- interquartile range (IQR)

These techniques can help detect statistical outliers and provide insights into whether the largest layoffs were isolated events or part of a wider systemic trend.

## Correlation Exploration
We would also like to explore the:

- correlation between company size (total employees) and layoff volumes\
- correlation between funding stage and layoff severity (for startups)

These analyses can further support our improved visualizations by revealing structural drivers of layoffs beyond just interest rates.

## Expected Outcome
Through these analyses, we aim to develop supporting insights that:

- explain why certain months and sectors experienced heavier layoffs,
- demonstrate data-driven reasoning behind our redesigned chart choices, and
- strengthen the narrative linking economic pressure to employment outcomes.

This analysis will not be overly complex, but it will enhance the rigor and depth of the final visualization.
