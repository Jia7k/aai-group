# Executive Summary
This report provides a critical analysis and redesign of a 4-dimensional bubble chart depicting "The Relationship Between Wealth and Happiness." While the original visualization attempts to display GDP per capita, happiness scores, population size, and continent data simultaneously, this multi-dimensional approach results in severe cognitive overload and data occlusion. Our redesign simplifies the visual encodings to reveal the underlying trends with greater accuracy.

# Introduction & Original Visualization

## Context
The original visualization aims to communicate how global wealth correlates with national happiness. It attempts to plot four distinct dimensions of data into a single 2D space using the following visual encodings:
1. **Wealth (GDP per capita):** Mapped to the horizontal X-axis (logarithmic scale).
2. **Happiness Score:** Mapped to the vertical Y-axis.
3. **Population:** Mapped to the size (area) of the data points.
4. **Continent:** Mapped to the color of the bubbles.

## Critique of the Original Design
Packing four variables into a single chart violates several core data visualization principles:
* **Severe Overplotting and Occlusion:** Massive bubbles representing highly populated countries physically cover up dozens of smaller data points.
* **The "Area" Perception Problem:** Human visual perception is poor at comparing 2D areas, reducing population data to vague estimations.
* **High Cognitive Load:** The viewer's brain must simultaneously track the X-axis, Y-axis, estimate area, and match color to a legend.
* **Misleading Density:** The logarithmic X-axis combined with overlapping bubbles creates a visual "traffic jam" on the right side of the chart.

# Methodology & Improvement Strategy

## Data Preparation
The initial step involves extracting the original variables (GDP, Happiness, Population, and Continent) and filtering the dataset for missing values.

## Planned Improvements
To resolve the occlusion and cognitive load issues, our primary strategy is to break the overloaded 4D chart into smaller components using a **Small Multiples** design strategy. This involves creating a grid of individual, aligned scatter plots—one for each continent. 

## Visualization Strategy & Final Design Choices
* **Chart Type:** Transitioned from a single bubble chart to small multiple scatter plots.
* **Visual Encodings:** The X and Y axes remain consistent across all plots. Population size is retained as bubble area, but with clutter removed, scaling is easier to interpret. 
* **Clarity:** Gridlines are softened and the color palette is standardized.
