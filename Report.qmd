# Executive Summary
This report provides a critical analysis and redesign of a 4-dimensional bubble chart depicting "Technical Layoffs Since the Fed Began Raising Interest Rates." While the original visualization attempts to display chronological dates, industry sectors, layoff volume, and sector groupings simultaneously, this multi-dimensional approach results in severe cognitive overload and data occlusion. Our redesign simplifies the visual encodings to reveal the underlying trends with greater accuracy.

# Introduction & Original Visualization

## Context
The original visualization aims to communicate the timing and scale of tech layoffs following U.S. interest rate hikes. The visualisation tells the industry-wide impact to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes, showing how different sectors downsized as borrowing costs rose. It attempts to plot four distinct dimensions of data into a single 2D space using the following visual encodings:\
1. **Date:** Mapped to the horizontal X-axis (chronological timeline).\
2. **Industry Sector:** Mapped to the vertical Y-axis (categorical).\
3. **Scale of Layoffs:** Mapped to the size (area) of the data points.\
4. **Sector Grouping:** Mapped to the color of the bubbles.

## Critique of the Original Design

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive Data Representation:** The visualisation provides a comprehensive, chronological view of layoffs across multiple sectors, allowing for a broad understanding of the impact of interest rate hikes.\
- **Use of Size:** Different bubble sizes effectively indicate the scale of layoffs, giving a quick visual cue about the magnitude of job losses in each sector.\

### Weaknesses
Packing four variables into a single chart violates several core data visualization principles:\
- **Severe Overplotting and Occlusion:** Massive bubbles representing companies physically cover up dozens of smaller layoff events in the same time period.\
- **The "Area" Perception Problem:** Human visual perception is poor at comparing 2D areas, making it difficult to differentiate the scale of layoffs between overlapping bubbles.\
- **High Cognitive Load:** The viewer's brain must simultaneously track the timeline, find the specific industry on the Y-axis, estimate the bubble area, and match color to a legend.\
- **Misleading Density:** The volume of overlapping circles in sections like "Big Tech" and "Retail" obscures the individual data points and specific dates.

# Methodology & Improvement Strategy

## Planned Improvements
To resolve the occlusion and cognitive load issues, our primary strategy is to break the overloaded 4D chart into smaller components using a **Small Multiples** design strategy. This involves creating a grid of individual, aligned scatter plots categorised by major sector groupings. 

## Data Source
- **Primary Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022 \
Data will be extracted from the Kaggle dataset, which contains detailed records of layoffs across various industries, including dates, company names, and layoff counts. Unlike the original visualisation which focused only on U.S. based companies, this dataset provides a global perspective, documenting layoff events internationally.


## Data Preparation
The initial step involves extracting the original variables (Date, Industry Sector, Layoff Count, and Company) and filtering the dataset for missing values to ensure data quality.
```{r}
#| label: data-prep
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# 1. Load the raw dataset
layoffs_raw <- read_csv("layoffs_data.csv")

# 2. Clean and transform the data
layoffs_clean <- layoffs_raw %>%
  
  # Convert the 'Date' column from text to actual Date objects
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) %>%
  
  # Extract Year and Month into separate columns (useful for aggregating bar charts later)
  mutate(Year = year(Date),
         Month = month(Date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>%
  
  # Drop administrative/text columns that are not useful for visualization
  select(-Source, -Date_Added, -List_of_Employees_Laid_Off) %>%
  
  # Convert categorical variables into 'factors' for easier plotting in ggplot2
  mutate(Industry = as.factor(Industry),
         Country = as.factor(Country),
         Stage = as.factor(Stage)) %>%
  
  # Handle Missing Values: Keep rows where AT LEAST ONE of the metrics is known
  # (Some companies report percentage laid off, but not the raw count, or vice versa)
  filter(!is.na(Laid_Off_Count) | !is.na(Percentage))

# 3. View a summary of the cleaned data
glimpse(layoffs_clean)
```

## Visualization Strategy & Final Design Choices
- **Chart Type:** Transitioned from a single, crowded bubble chart to small multiple scatter plots for each sector.\
- **Visual Encodings:** The X and Y axes remain consistent across all plots. Bubble size is retained for layoff volume, but with clutter removed, scaling is easier to interpret.\
- **Clarity:** Gridlines are softened and the color palette is standardized  to ensure final result is aesthetically pleasing and professional.
